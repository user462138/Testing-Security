## Introduction
Software testing is crucial for ensuring the reliability, functionality, and security of any application. In this course, we delve into:
- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- End-to-End Testing
- Security Testing

## Types of Testing
### 1. Unit Testing
Unit tests focus on small, isolated sections of code to validate their correctness. These are typically automated and can be run frequently during development.

### 2. Integration Testing
Integration tests assess the interaction between different modules or components to ensure that they work well together.

### 3. End-to-End Testing
End-to-End tests simulate real user scenarios to ensure the system behaves as expected across various layers.

### 4. Security Testing
Security testing ensures that the software is protected against threats and vulnerabilities. This includes testing for:
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Authentication and Authorization

## Security in Software Testing
Security is a top priority in software development. The course covers:
- Identifying vulnerabilities in the software
- Writing test cases for security exploits
- Automated tools for penetration testing

## Best Practices
- Always write tests as part of the development cycle.
- Focus on code coverage but avoid over-testing trivial code.
- Regularly update security test cases as new vulnerabilities are discovered.
- Ensure that tests are fast and maintainable.
